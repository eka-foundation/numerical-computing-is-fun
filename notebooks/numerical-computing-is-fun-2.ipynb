Instead of talking about gates or 0 and 1, in Boolean logic we talk about <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. Either something is true, or it's false. When you hear about Boolean Logic for the first time, it sounds confusing, but actually it is really as simple as that. \n",

Actually it's not just one computer, but a network of almost 200,000 computers that are dedicating their available resources to looking for the next big prime number. It's called [GIMPS](https://www.mersenne.org/). That's pretty cool stuff right?"

    "Let's be realistic, we're not going to find such a big number with our small lonely computer. What we can do, is create a simple program that more or less does what the gigantic network of computers in GIMPS do. For now, let's wrap up here and continue in the next part, where we will learn about putting into use the building blocks we already have, and create our very first algoritm. A prime number solving algorithm to be more precise!\n",

    "\n",
    "- Prime numbers relate with divisibility\n",
    "- Divisibility means that when one number is divided by other, the product is not a whole number\n",
    "- A prime number is any number that is divisible only by itself and 1\n",
    "- Binary means 0 and 1, <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>\n",
    "- Boolean logic is the binary language of computers \n",
    "- Python gives us an easy to use way to instruct computers\n",
    "- Boolean logic statements involve 'is', 'is not', 'and' and 'or' statements\n",
    "- Boolean statements can be joined together\n",
    "- Boolean statements always return either True or False as output\n",
    "- It's generally easy to perform computing operations with small numbers\n",
    "- The biggest prime number is a really big number\n",
    "- Very big numbers require vast networks of computers joined together\n",

    "While it may seem that we are dealing with very simple things, actually we've already covered some of the most important concepts of computer programming. You're on your way to knowing how to tell computers what you want them to do!"
