We will focus on understanding what algorithms are, and creating one of our own (for looking for prime numbers). As a reminder from [Part 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mikkokotila/jupyter4kids/blob/master/notebooks/numerical-computing-is-fun-1.ipynb), prime numbers are the numbers that all other numbers are made of. This also means that any number that is only divisible by 1 or itself, is a prime number. Consequently any number that is divisible by a number other than 1 or itself, is not a prime number."

For now, we're going to focus on the most commonly used type of loop, a 'for' loop. A for loop is a way to say that some process will go on *for* as long as something is true.
